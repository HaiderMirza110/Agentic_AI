## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System with LangChain, Gemini Flash, and Pinecone

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LangChain, Google Gemini Flash, and Pinecone. The system retrieves relevant information from a vector database (Pinecone) to improve the accuracy and context of responses generated by the Gemini Flash large language model (LLM).

**Benefits:**

* **Improved Response Quality:** Gemini Flash is augmented with factual context retrieved from Pinecone, leading to more informative and accurate responses.
* **Enhanced Relevance:** The retrieved information aligns with the user's query, ensuring responses are directly relevant to the topic.
* **Streamlined Workflow:** LangChain facilitates the integration of these components, creating a smooth retrieval-generation pipeline.


**Components:**

* **LangChain:** A framework for building NLP pipelines. It allows us to easily chain together different processes like data preprocessing, retrieval, and generation.
* **Google Gemini Flash:** A powerful LLM capable of generating human-quality text. In this system, it acts as the text generation component.
* **Pinecone:** A high-performance vector database. It stores and retrieves information efficiently based on semantic similarity.

**Project Structure:**

* **History of Agentic AI.txt:** Contains the text data used to populate the Pinecone vector database.
* **LangChain RAG Project.ipynb:** Houses Jupyter notebooks for data preparation, Pinecone interaction, and RAG system implementation using LangChain.
* **Requirements.txt:** Lists the Python dependencies required for running the project.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python 3.x and LangChain installed. Refer to the LangChain documentation for installation instructions: [https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)
2. **Set Up Pinecone:** Create a Pinecone account and API key. Configure the connection details in the notebooks.
3. **Prepare Data:** Preprocess and format your text data for Pinecone ingestion, as outlined in the provided notebooks.
4. **Run Notebooks:** Execute the notebooks in the specified order to populate Pinecone, build the RAG pipeline with LangChain, and test the system's functionality.


**Further Development:**

* Experiment with different Gemini Flash models and Pinecone configurations.
* Fine-tune the retrieval process based on your specific use case.
* Integrate the RAG system into a larger application or user interface.




**Disclaimer:** This project is for educational and demonstrational purposes. Google Gemini Flash is currently in an experimental phase, and its availability may change.
