Here are some fun facts about each of the five cricketers, keeping in mind the inherent subjectivity of such a ranking:

**1. Babar Azam (Pakistan):**

* **Fun Fact:** Babar Azam is known for his incredibly high batting average across all three formats of the game (Test, ODI, and T20I).  He's often compared to the greats for his consistent run-scoring.  He actually surpassed Virat Kohli in ODI rankings for a period.

**2. Virat Kohli (India):**

* **Fun Fact:** Virat Kohli holds the record for the fastest to reach 70 international centuries. This showcases his phenomenal run-scoring prowess throughout his career. He also has an incredible record chasing down targets.

**3. Rohit Sharma (India):**

* **Fun Fact:** Rohit Sharma holds the world record for the highest individual score in a One Day International (ODI) match – a staggering 264 runs!  This score remains a testament to his explosive batting capabilities.

**4. Pat Cummins (Australia):**

* **Fun Fact:** Pat Cummins is not only a brilliant fast bowler, but he’s also captained the Australian Test team, showcasing his leadership skills and all-round contribution to the team's success.  This is quite rare for a fast bowler.

**5. Jasprit Bumrah (India):**

These fun facts highlight aspects beyond just their statistics, adding a touch of the engaging stories behind their careers and impact on the game. Remember, many other exceptional players could easily be included in a "top 5" list; this is just one possible interpretation.
